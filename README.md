# Secret-Santa
This was a very simple Secret Santa program I made so that we can randomly receive someone virtually via a text document .

How this works:
There are 2 main ways that this program can be used; (1) either by having a user input each name manually into a predefined list or (2) by running the program and entering each name one at a time.

Part 1:

(1) If you were to use this option, you must first add the names into the predefined list on line 5 and then run the program.

(2) If this is the option you were to use then you would need to uncomment the lines 9-19 and lines 5-6 can be left untouched however it commenting them out is prefered.

Part 2:

This part has to be changed regardless, it is the directory which you want all the text documents to be create at (line 31).


Note: if the files were to be sent over discord then the document preview can potentially spoil any secret. An easy solution would be to send each text doucment into a compressed zip folder and then send the zip folder instead.
